II. Development
1. Add creation_date and update_date columns to all tables in HR schema. - Done on 02.06.2023! (II_1_Scripts.txt)
2. Fill in creation_date values from December, 2022. Every table should have 5 separate date values for their records. - Done on 02.06.2023! (II_2_Scripts.txt)
3. Create a trigger for each table - on insert: if creation_date != sysdate then creation_date := sysdate;
   On update: update_date := sysdate; - Done on 05.06.2023! (II_3_Scripts.txt)
4. Working on tasks 2.4 and 2.5:
   Create a package export_hr with public procedure start_daily_export with 2 input parameters:
   p_date_export of date datatype with defaul value of sysdate and p_is_fullexport with of number datatype with default value of 0.
   
   When starting start_daily_export procedure with p_is_fullexport = 1:
   - The structure of all HR tables should be exported to files
   (a file for each table with name table_nameoftable_dateofexport(.txt/.sql) or other file format).
   - All data for each table to be exported into a separate file per table with name:
   data_nameoftable_dateofexport with file format of my choosing.
   
   When starting start_daily_export procedure with p_is_fullexport = 0:
   - Export the data of the tables in HR which are "newer" then the last exported records or old records with changes in them.
   Again, a single file per table with name data_nameoftable_dateofexport with file format of my choosing.
